# ViPR Supplementary Material

ViPR is in its essence a collection of videos with task-specific metadata and labels. The videos have to be downloaded separately (>3GB in size), but the tasks and metadata are included directly in the supplemetary material. 

The directory `evaluation` contains code that can be used to replicate the results from the paper. For people who would like to use the dataset directly with _their_ evaluation code, we also supply all the video metadata in `dataset.json`, although our code uses a slightly different structure of the same data.

For more information, see the documentation:

- `documentation.pdf` contains description of the dataset, the data collection protocols, and details about evaluation
- `datasheet.pdf` contains documentation in the datasheet for datasets format
- `croissant.json` contains the croissant spec for the dataset
