  A few tips and hints to help you get started:

  - ''Holding an object'' is depicted as the object being at the very bottom of the
  screen and close to the camera, without any visible hands. Similarly, no hands are
  shown for cleaning, heating, or any other action.

  - No action happens before the first frame. If the first frame starts with us already
  holding an object, it was already in our hands from the beginning.

  - The objects almost never lie on the floor. If the object is at the bottom of the
  screen, close to the camera and looks like it is lying on the floor, we are most
  likely just holding it.

  - The possible actions that can be performed are: pickup(object, location), put(object,
  location), heat(object, microwave), cool(object, fridge), clean(object, sink), slice(object),
  toggle(object), and goto(location). You should formulate your descriptions of what
  happened since the last frame based on these actions.

  - To be able to `put` something, we first need to `pick` it up (or start with it
  in our hands).

  - If we had something in hand in a frame, and it is not visible in the next frame,
  we must have performed a `put` action.

  - If we didn''t have anything in hand in a frame, and something appears in our hands
  in the next frame, we must have performed a `pick` action

  - Slicing can only happen if we have a knife in our hands

  - Cleaning involves putting an object in a sink, running water over it, and then
  picking it back up

  - Heating involves putting an object in a microwave, turning the microwave on, turning
  it off, and then picking the object back up

  - Cooling involves putting an object in a fridge, closing the fridge, opening it,
  and then picking the object back up

  - Multiple actions can happen between frames, though MOST OFTEN it will just be
  a combination of goto and one other action. For example, it is unlikely we sliced
  AND put down the knife inbetween two frames.

  - You are bound not to recognize some objects correctly, which might hurt your peformance
  in downstream tasks. Instead of running with your first guess, try to list a few
  alternatives for an object if you''re unsure what it is.

  - Whenever we hold a knife, we might be about to slice an object. Pay very close
  attention to minute details in objects'' appearance. If there are small lines in
  the object where there previously weren''t any, it is likely that we have sliced
  it. But it might have been already sliced, or maybe we just do not plan to slice
  it, even though we hold a knife.

  - Sometimes, when putting down an object, we put it in or onto another object, instead
  of a container. In that case you should describe the object we put the object in
  or onto in addition to the general place this "container" is in.

  - Similarly, sometimes we pick up an object that has another object in it. In that
  case, list both objects in your description.

prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. For each frame, concisely describe the scene, the objects we're holding, and
  from that deduce what actions have likely been performed since the last frame.
