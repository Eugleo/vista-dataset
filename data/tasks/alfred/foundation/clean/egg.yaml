  A few tips and hints to help you get started:

  - ''Holding an object'' is depicted as the object being at the very bottom of the
  screen and close to the camera, without any visible hands. Similarly, no hands are
  shown for cleaning, heating, or any other action.

  - The objects almost never lie on the floor. If the object is at the bottom of the
  screen, close to the camera and looks like it is lying on the floor, we are most
  likely just holding it.

  - Proper cleaning involves putting an object in a sink, running water over it, and
  then picking it back up


  Example with the tips applied:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are near the countertop. There is a egg at the bottom of the screen, which
  suggests we are holding it.

  2. We are now near a sink. The egg is still at the bottom of the screen, so we are
  definitely holding it.

  3. The egg now lies in the sink, along with other objects. The water is not running
  yet.

  4. The egg is still in the sink. The water is still not running.

  5. We are holding the egg again, as depicted by it being at the bottom of the screen
  again. Although it was in the sink, we didn''t run water over it, which means we
  did not clean it.

prompt_gpt: The frames will depict us carrying a egg to a sink and then possibly cleaning
  it under running water. Your eventual goal will be to discern whether all the steps
  required for cleaning the object actually happened, but you shouldn't lock-in to
  one answer too early. Instead, for each frame, concisely describe the scene, the
  objects we're holding, and from that deduce what actions have likely been performed
  since the last frame.
