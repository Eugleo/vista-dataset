  A few tips and hints to help you get started:

  - ''Holding an object'' is depicted as the object being at the very bottom of the
  screen and close to the camera, without any visible hands. Similarly, no hands are
  shown for cleaning, heating, or any other action.

  - The objects almost never lie on the floor. If the object is at the bottom of the
  screen, close to the camera and looks like it is lying on the floor, we are most
  likely just holding it.

  - Sometimes the faucet will be barely visible in the frame. Still, you should be
  able to discern whether it is shining (and thus on) or not.


  Example with the tips applied:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are near the countertop. We see a faucet in front of us.

  2. The faucet doesn''t seem to be turned on. There is no light coming from it.

  3. Nothing has changed; the faucet is still off.

  4. Again, similar frame, the faucet is still off, as we would expect.

  5. For the entire length of the video, the faucet has been off.
