  A few tips and hints to help you get started:

  - ''Holding an object'' is depicted as the object being at the very bottom of the
  screen and close to the camera, without any visible hands. Similarly, no hands are
  shown for cleaning, heating, or any other action.

  - The objects almost never lie on the floor. If the object is at the bottom of the
  screen, close to the camera and looks like it is lying on the floor, we are most
  likely just holding it.

  - Cooling an object involves holding it, opening the fridge, putting it in a fridge,
  closing the fridge, opening the fridge, and picking the object back up. Proper cooling
  needs to have all these parts.


  Example with the tips applied:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are near the countertop. There is slice of bread at the bottom of the screen,
  which suggests we are holding it.

  2. We are now near a fridge. The slice of bread is still at the bottom of the screen,
  so we are definitely holding it.

  3. The fridge is now open. We still hold the slice of bread.

  4. The fridge is now closed. We still hold the slice of bread. This means we did
  not put the object in the fridge.

  5. We are holding the slice of bread, still. It seems we just opened and closed
  the fridge without putting the slice of bread in, even for a moment. The cooling
  did not happen.

label_prompts:
  label_0: We cool the slice of bread by putting it in the fridge for a while
  label_1: We open the fridge, put in the slice of bread and immediately pick it back
    up without leaving it to cool in a closed fridge
  label_2: We open the fridge and then immediately close it without putting the slice
    of bread in
  label_3: We go to the fridge and then we leave, without even opening it

prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us carrying a slice of bread to a fridge and then possibly
  cooling it by leaving it in a closed fridge for a while before picking it up again.
  Your eventual goal will be to discern whether all the steps required for cooling
  the object actually happened, but you shouldn't lock-in to one answer too early.
  Instead, for each frame, concisely describe the scene, the objects we're holding,
  and what actions have likely been performed since the last frame.
