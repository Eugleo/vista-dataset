  A few tips and hints to help you get started:

  - ''Holding an object'' is depicted as the object being at the very bottom of the
  screen and close to the camera, without any visible hands. Similarly, no hands are
  shown for cleaning, heating, or any other action.

  - The objects almost never lie on the floor. If the object is at the bottom of the
  screen, close to the camera and looks like it is lying on the floor, we are most
  likely just holding it.

  - Sometimes it is hard to see where exactly we put the object. However, if we held
  it in a frame and we don''t hold it in the next frame, we definitely had to put
  it somewhere.

  - We will never pick up an object and put it down in the same frame. Only exactly
  one of these will happen.

  - Sometimes, when putting down an object, we put it in or onto another object, instead
  of a container. In that case you should describe the object we put the object in
  or onto in addition to the general place this "container" is in.

  - Similarly, sometimes we pick up an object that has another object in it. In that
  case, list both objects in your description.


  Example with the tips applied:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are near a countertop or a large table.

  2. Now it seems we walked near a windowsill. We don''t appear to have anything in
  hand. There is a fork on the windowsill, along with a toaster, and a bowl or a plate.

  3. We seem to be holding the fork now, because it is at the bottom of the screen,
  almost as if it was lying on the floor.

  4. We still hold the fork. We are further from the windowsill now, possibly walking
  towards somewhere else.

  5. We still hold the fork.

prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us handling a fork, and your eventual goal will be
  to discern whether picked it up during the video, or started out holding it and
  put it down somewhere. You shouldn't lock-in to one answer too early. Instead, for
  each frame, concisely describe the scene, the state of the fork, and what actions
  have likely been performed since the last frame.
