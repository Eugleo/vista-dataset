example_gpt: 'A few tips and hints to help you get started:

  - ''Holding an object'' is depicted as the object being at the very bottom of the
  screen and close to the camera, without any visible hands. Similarly, no hands are
  shown for cleaning, heating, or any other action.

  - The objects almost never lie on the floor. If the object is at the bottom of the
  screen, close to the camera and looks like it is lying on the floor, we are most
  likely just holding it.

  - You are bound not to recognize some objects correctly, which might hurt your peformance
  in downstream tasks. Instead of running with your first guess, try to list a few
  alternatives for an object if you''re unsure what it is.

  - If we didn''t have anything in hand in a frame, and something appears in our hands
  in the next frame, we must have performed a `pick` action


  Example with the tips applied:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are in the middle of the room. We do not see the None yet.

  2. The location has changed. We see something that might be the None. We see a multitude
  of objects there, among them a toaster, a butter knife, a laptop, and a mug, and
  a pan or possibly a bowl.

  2. The scene has not changed much since the last frame. We are still near the None.

  3. We see a rectangular object at the bottom of the screen, suggesting we are holding
  it. Considering the selection of objects on the None we saw above, it is likely
  the laptop or the toaster.

  4. The angle has changed a bit and we see that the laptop is still on the None.
  This means the thing we hold must be the toaster, based on our previous observations.

  5. We are now a bit further away from the None. We are still holding the toaster.'

prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us or putting down an object into (or on) a None. Your
  eventual goal will be to recognize the object, but you shouldn't lock-in to one
  answer too early. Instead, try to describe the object as accurately as possible
  separately for each frame, refining your answer as you see more frames.
