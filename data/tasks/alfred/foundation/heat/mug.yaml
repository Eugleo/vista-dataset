  A few tips and hints to help you get started:

  - ''Holding an object'' is depicted as the object being at the very bottom of the
  screen and close to the camera, without any visible hands. Similarly, no hands are
  shown for cleaning, heating, or any other action.

  - The objects almost never lie on the floor. If the object is at the bottom of the
  screen, close to the camera and looks like it is lying on the floor, we are most
  likely just holding it.

  - Proper heating involves putting an object in a microwave, closing the door, turning
  the microwave on, turning it off, opening the door and then picking the object back
  up

  - When the microwave is turned on, it lights up


  Example with the tips applied:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are near the countertop. There is a mug at the bottom of the screen, which
  suggests we are holding it.

  2. We are now near a microwave. The mug is still at the bottom of the screen, so
  we are still holding it.

  3. The mug now lies in the microwave. The microwave is open and thus not running,
  so we are not heating the mug up yet.

  4. The mug is still in the microwave. The microwave is still open.

  5. We are holding the mug again, as depicted by it being at the bottom of the screen
  again. Although it was in the microwave, we didn''t close the microwave and turn
  it on, which means we did not clean it.

prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us carrying a mug to a microwave and then possibly
  heating it there. Your eventual goal will be to discern whether all the steps required
  for heating the object actually happened, but you shouldn't lock-in to one answer
  too early. Instead, for each frame, concisely describe the scene, the objects we're
  holding, and what actions have likely been performed since the last frame.
