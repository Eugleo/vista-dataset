  A few tips and hints to help you get started:

  - ''Holding an object'' is depicted as the object being at the very bottom of the
  screen and close to the camera, without any visible hands. Similarly, no hands are
  shown for cleaning, heating, or any other action.

  - The objects almost never lie on the floor. If the object is at the bottom of the
  screen, close to the camera and looks like it is lying on the floor, we are most
  likely just holding it.

  - We are sure that you will observe a apple being picked up. If you can barely see
  it, maybe you just picked up a very thin slice that is angled weirdly.

  - Sometimes we will pick up slices, sometimes wedges, but you can usually ignore
  this, as long as you can tell whether the object is whole or not.


  Example with the tips applied:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are nearing a countertop. We see a apple lying on the countertop. It is hard
  to see whether it is sliced or not when it''s lying down like this.

  2. We are now standing directly at the countertop.

  3. We picked up the apple. It seems to be a wedge instead of the whole thing.

  4. We now changed our position again. We can now see the potato is just a wedge
  since we can see the inner texture.

  5. We are now nearing a fridge, still holding the apple, as signified by it being
  at the bottom of the screen.

prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us picking up a apple, or possibly just a piece or
  slice of it. Your eventual goal will be to say whether the object was picked up
  whole, or if just a piece of it was picked, but you shouldn't lock-in to one answer
  too early. Instead, for each frame, concisely describe the scene, the state of the
  apple, and what actions have likely been performed since the last frame.
