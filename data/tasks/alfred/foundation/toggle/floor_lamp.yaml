  A few tips and hints to help you get started:

  - ''Holding an object'' is depicted as the object being at the very bottom of the
  screen and close to the camera, without any visible hands. Similarly, no hands are
  shown for cleaning, heating, or any other action.

  - The objects almost never lie on the floor. If the object is at the bottom of the
  screen, close to the camera and looks like it is lying on the floor, we are most
  likely just holding it.

  - We might be carrying an object in the frames, but what we care about the most
  is turning other objects on or off.

  - The state of the floor lamp will change exactly once in the frames, from on to
  off or vice versa.


  Example with the tips applied:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are near the countertop. We see a floor lamp in front of us.

  2. The floor lamp doesn''t seem to be turned on.

  3. Nothing has changed; the floor lamp is still off.

  4. Now, the floor lamp is turned on. We can see this because it the light inside
  has turned on.

  5. The floor lamp is still on.
