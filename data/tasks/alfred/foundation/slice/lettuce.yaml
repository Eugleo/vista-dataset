  A few tips and hints to help you get started:

  - ''Holding an object'' is depicted as the object being at the very bottom of the
  screen and close to the camera, without any visible hands. Similarly, no hands are
  shown for cleaning, heating, or any other action, not even slicing.

  - The objects almost never lie on the floor. If the object is at the bottom of the
  screen, close to the camera and looks like it is lying on the floor, we are most
  likely just holding it.

  - Sometimes we just walk to an object with a knife in hand without slicing the object.
  To see whether an object has been sliced, first find it in the frame, and then observe
  how it changes in the following frames. A sliced object will have small, barely
  noticeable lines on it.

  - Whenever we hold a knife, we might be about to slice an object. Pay very close
  attention to minute details in objects'' appearance. If there are small lines in
  the object where there previously weren''t any, it is likely that we have sliced
  it. But it might have been already sliced, or maybe we just do not plan to slice
  it, even though we hold a knife.


  Example with the tips applied:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are near the countertop. A butter knife is shown on the bottom of the screen,
  which means we are holding it, as expected.

  2. We have walked near a windowsill, upon which there is a multitude of objects,
  including lettuce. The knife is still at the bottom of the screen, so we are definitely
  holding it.

  3. We are holding the knife still, but it is not clear if we are using it. Focusing
  on the lettuce, it seems unchanged.

  4. The lettuce now has lines on it, which suggests we have sliced it. We still hold
  the knife, and the lettuce is still in the same place.

  5. We are still near the windowsill. We now see the lettuce from a different angle,
  and although we now do not see the slicing lines, we did slice it according to the
  previous frame.

prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us carrying a knife and walking towards a lettuce.
  Your eventual goal will be to discern whether we sliced the lettuce at the end of
  the video or not, but you shouldn't lock-in to one answer too early. Instead, for
  each frame, concisely describe the scene, the state of the lettuce, and what actions
  have likely been performed since the last frame.
