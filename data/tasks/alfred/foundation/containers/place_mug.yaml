example_gpt: 'A few tips and hints to help you get started:

  - ''Holding an object'' is depicted as the object being at the very bottom of the
  screen and close to the camera, without any visible hands. Similarly, no hands are
  shown for cleaning, heating, or any other action.

  - The objects almost never lie on the floor. If the object is at the bottom of the
  screen, close to the camera and looks like it is lying on the floor, we are most
  likely just holding it.

  - You are bound not to recognize some objects correctly, which might hurt your peformance
  in downstream tasks. Instead of running with your first guess, try to list a few
  alternatives for an object if you''re unsure what it is.


  Example with the tips applied:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are in the middle of the room. We do not see any mug yet.

  2. The location has changed. We see something that might be the mug. It seems to
  be in a pot which itself is on a sofa.

  2. The scene has not changed much since the last frame. We are still near the sofa.
  The mug is in the bottom of the frame and close to the camera, suggesting we are
  holding it now. Considering the descriptions above, it is likely that the mug was
  picked up from a pot, or possibly from a sofa.

  4. Not much has changed, we are still near the sofa, and we still hold the mug.

  5. We are now a bit further away from the sofa. We are still holding the mug.'

prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us putting down a mug somewhere. Your eventual goal
  will be to recognize the place or container we put the object in (or on), but you
  shouldn't lock-in to one answer too early. Instead, try to describe the place or
  container as accurately as possible separately for each frame, refining your answer
  as you see more frames.
