example_gpt: 'A few tips and hints to help you get started:

  - ''Holding an object'' is depicted as the object being at the very bottom of the
  screen and close to the camera, without any visible hands. Similarly, no hands are
  shown for cleaning, heating, or any other action.

  - The objects almost never lie on the floor. If the object is at the bottom of the
  screen, close to the camera and looks like it is lying on the floor, we are most
  likely just holding it.

  - You are bound not to recognize some objects correctly, which might hurt your peformance
  in downstream tasks. Instead of running with your first guess, try to list a few
  alternatives for an object if you''re unsure what it is.


  Example with the tips applied:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are in the middle of the room. We do not see any key chain yet.

  2. The location has changed. We see something that might be the key chain. It seems
  to be in a pot which itself is on a sofa.

  2. The scene has not changed much since the last frame. We are still near the sofa.
  The key chain is in the bottom of the frame and close to the camera, suggesting
  we are holding it now. Considering the descriptions above, it is likely that the
  key chain was picked up from a pot, or possibly from a sofa.

  4. Not much has changed, we are still near the sofa, and we still hold the key chain.

  5. We are now a bit further away from the sofa. We are still holding the key chain.'

prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us putting down a key chain somewhere. Your eventual
  goal will be to recognize the place or container we put the object in (or on), but
  you shouldn't lock-in to one answer too early. Instead, try to describe the place
  or container as accurately as possible separately for each frame, refining your
  answer as you see more frames.
