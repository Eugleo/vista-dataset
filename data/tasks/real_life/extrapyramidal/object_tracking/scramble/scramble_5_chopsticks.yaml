Example:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. Four apples are in a line on a table. We will call them apple A, B, C, and D, from left to right.
  The leftmost, apple A, is partly obscured by a hand which seems about to pick it up.

  2. There are now three apples in a triangle shape on the table near the top of the image.
  The arm is reaching toward the apple at the lower left corner of the triangle, and the arm is partly
  obscuring another apple at the bottom of the image. The two apples that are the lower corners of the
  triangle appear to be in the same place and orientation as apples B and D. Most likely, we have placed
  apple A at the top middle, moved apple C to the bottom, set it down, and will likely move apple B or A next,
  since the hand seems to be reaching toward one of those two further to the left rather than apple D to the right.

  3. We are picking up a apple from the top of the image. On the bottom right, a apple on the table is visible;
  the other two apples are mostly blocked by the arm, but partly visible. The two blocked apples are arranged almost
  vertically relative to each other, with the lower one slightly lower than the apple at the bottom right,
  and the top one significantly higher, near the middle of the image. In the previous frame, no apples were aligned
  vertically, so at least one of the two obscured apples has been moved; also, only apple C was at the bottom of the image,
  and now there are two apples at the bottom: one at the middle, and one at the right. The apple at the bottom middle
  seems to be apple C which we placed there in the previous frame, and the apple at the bottom right seems lighter in color
  than the others, like apple B. So, we likely picked up apple B, as it seemed like we were going to in the previous frame,
  then placed it back down at the bottom right. The apple vertically above apple C, which is mostly obscured by the arm,
  does not seem to match the position of any apple in the previous frame. So this may be apple A or D. The final apple,
  which the hand is reaching toward, is at the very top of the image. It is in the same orientation as apple A was in the
  previous frame, so this is likely apple A. Therefore, it''s apple D that is in the middle of the table obscured by the arm.

  4. Now, there are three apples in a horizontal line at the middle, slightly to the left.
  There is also an apple at the bottom right not in the line. A hand is over the apple in the line that is furthest to the right.
  The apple at the bottom right seems to be apple B, which was at the bottom right in the previous frame and lighter in color
  than the others. No two apples in the previous frame were aligned horizontally, so at least two apples have been moved.
  One of these is likely apple A, since the hand was reaching for it in the previous frame. The apple that the hand is currently over
  is probably the other apple that was moved, since we know that at least two apples were moved, and apple A was moved first.
  It seems like the apple in the middle of the horizontal line could be in the same place that apple D was in the previous frame.
  Furthermore, there is no longer an apple at the bottom middle of the image. So, the apple that was at the bottom middle in the previous frame,
  which was apple C, is likely the apple that the hand is over now. The only apple we haven''t tracked yet is apple A, which must by process of elimination
  be the apple at the left of the horizontal line.

  5. All four apples are back in a line on the table, and the hand is no longer visible. The three apples that were in a line in the previous frame
  seem to match the three apples to the left in this frame. Most likely, apple B was moved up from the bottom right
  to be the rightmost apple in the line, and indeed the rightmost apple looks somewhat lighter than the others.
  Therefore, it is still apple A which is furthest to the left at the end of the video.

label_prompts:
  same: The object that was furthest to the left at the start of the video is still furthest to the left at the end 
  diff: The object that was furthest to the left at the start of the video is no longer furthest to the left at the end
prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us moving around several objects on a table. Your eventual goal
  will be to discern whether the object that started out furthest to the left is still furthest
  to the left at the end of the video. The object may have been moved during the video; we just
  want to know if it was moved back to where it originally started. You shouldn't lock-in to one
  answer too early. Instead, try to describe the frames as accurately as possible, reasoning about
  the location of all the objects and how they compare to the previous frame.
