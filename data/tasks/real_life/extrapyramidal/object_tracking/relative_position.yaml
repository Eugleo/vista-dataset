label_prompts:
  left: We pick up the object on the left
  middle: We pick up the object in the middle
  right: We pick up the object on the right
prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us picking up one of three objects arranged in a line.
  Your goal is to discern which of the three objects was picked up. You shouldn't lock-in to one
  answer too early. Instead, try to describe the frames as accurately as possible, reasoning about
  the location of all the objects and how they compare to the previous frame.
