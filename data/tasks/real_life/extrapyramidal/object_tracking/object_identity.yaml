Example:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. A can and an apple sit on a table. The can is to the left of the apple. A hand is in the lower left corner,
  and appears to be reaching toward the can.

  2. The can is now closer to the center and top of the image than it was before, and the hand is touching the apple,
  which is in the same position as before.

  3. We are now holding the apple at the bottom of the image. The can is still at the top of the image.

  4. The apple is further to the right. We are holding the can at the top of the image.

  5. The can is now back to its original position on the left side of the table, and the apple is still on the right.
  The hand is no longer visible. The can is still furthest to the left, so the object that was furthest to the left
  at the start of the video is still furthest to the left at the end.

label_prompts:
  same: The object that was furthest to the left at the start of the video is still furthest to the left at the end 
  different: The object that was furthest to the left at the start of the video is no longer furthest to the left at the end
prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us moving around several objects on a table. Your eventual goal
  will be to discern whether the object that started out furthest to the left is still furthest
  to the left at the end of the video. The object may have been moved during the video; we just
  want to know if it was moved back to where it originally started. You shouldn't lock-in to one
  answer too early. Instead, try to describe the frames as accurately as possible, reasoning about
  the location of all the objects and how they compare to the previous frame.
