label_prompts:
  opening: A door opens
  closing: A door closes

prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will show footage of a door. This may be the door to a room, a
  cabinet, an airplane, or anything else. Your task is to describe whether it is
  opening or closing during the video, but you shouldn't lock-in to one answer too
  early. Instead, try to describe the changes among the frames as accurately as
  possible separately for each frame, refining your answer as you see more frames.
