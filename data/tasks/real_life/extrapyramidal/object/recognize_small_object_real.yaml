Example:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. In this frame, we see a table covered with different objects, but the angle is such that we can''t see what the agent is focusing on.

  2. We are nearing the table, and we see that the agent is focusing on an apple.

  3. In the end, the agent picks up a can instead. The can is now held in the air in front of the camera.

  4. The can is being held, but our position has changed.

  5. We are now in front of a table, and the can is still held in the air.

  apple: We pick up an apple from a cluttered table
  can: We pick up a can from a cluttered table
  hammer: We pick up a hammer from a cluttered table

prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us putting down $(A_OR_AN_OBJ) somewhere. Your eventual goal
  will be to recognize the place or container we put the object in (or on), but you
  shouldn't lock-in to one answer too early. Instead, try to describe the place or
  container as accurately as possible separately for each frame, refining your answer
  as you see more frames.
