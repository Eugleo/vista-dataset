Example:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. In this frame, we see a close-up of two pieces of black fabric next to each other over a wooden surface.

  2. A long metal object has appeared over the right piece of fabric. It is very blurry and only partly visible, but is presumably a pin.

  3. Very little is visible in this frame--the two pieces of fabric look crumpled and part of what might be a finger is visible at the top of the frame.

  4. A thumbnail is taking up most of the right of the frame, with the fabric on the left. The pin is not visible.

  5. A long metal object is now over the left piece of fabric. Since the pin came from the right, it is likely that the pin has been threaded
  through the fabric. The pin is not visible entering the fabric on the right side, so most likely only the left side was pinned. However,
  it may be that the right side was pinned but the point where the pin entered the fabric was not visible in the frame.

label_prompts:
  pin: We pinned two pieces of fabric together
  no_pin: We didn't pin two pieces of fabric together

prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us either pinning together two pieces of fabric,
  or failing to pin together the fabric by instead pinning only one side or neither side.
  Your eventual goal will be to determine whether we successfully pinned both pieces
  of fabric together such that the fabric is pinned at the end of the video,
  but you shouldn't lock-in to one answer too early. Instead, try to describe
  the interactions of the pin, fabric, and fingers as accurately as possible separately
  for each frame, refining your answer as you see more frames.
