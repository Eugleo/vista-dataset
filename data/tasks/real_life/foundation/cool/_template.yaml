  Example:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are near the countertop. We are holding $(A_OR_AN_OBJ) at the bottom of the screen.

  2. We are now near a freezer. We are still holding the $(OBJ) at the bottom of the screen.

  3. The freezer is now open. We still hold the $(OBJ).

  4. The freezer is now closed. We still hold the $(OBJ). This means we did not put
  the object in the freezer.

  5. We are holding the $(OBJ), still. It seems we just opened and closed the freezer
  without putting the $(OBJ) in, even for a moment. The cooling did not happen.

label_prompts:
  freeze: We cool the $(OBJ) by putting it in the freezer for a while
  put_no_close: We open the freezer, put in the $(OBJ) and immediately pick it back up
    without leaving it to cool in the closed freezer
  open_no_put: We open the freezer and then immediately close it without putting the $(OBJ)
    in
  approach: We go to the freezer and then we leave, without even opening it

prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us carrying $(A_OR_AN_OBJ) to a freezer and then possibly
  cooling it by leaving it in the closed freezer for a while before picking it up again.
  Your eventual goal will be to discern whether all the steps required for cooling
  the object actually happened, but you shouldn't lock-in to one answer too early.
  Instead, for each frame, concisely describe the scene, the objects we're holding,
  and what actions have likely been performed since the last frame.
