  Example:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are near the countertop. We are holding a mug at the bottom of the screen.

  2. We are now near a microwave. We are still holding the mug at the bottom of the screen.

  3. The mug is in the microwave. The microwave is open and thus not running,
  so we are not heating the mug up yet.

  4. The mug is still in the microwave. The microwave is still open.

  5. We are holding the mug again. Although it was in the microwave, we didn''t close the
  microwave and turn it on, which means we did not heat it.

prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us carrying a mug to a microwave and then possibly
  heating it there. Your eventual goal will be to discern whether all the steps required
  for heating the object actually happened, but you shouldn't lock-in to one answer
  too early. Instead, for each frame, concisely describe the scene, the objects we're
  holding, and what actions have likely been performed since the last frame.
