  Example:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are near the countertop. We are holding $(A_OR_AN_OBJ) at the bottom of the screen.

  2. We are now near a microwave. We are still holding the $(OBJ) at the bottom of the screen.

  3. The $(OBJ) is in the microwave. The microwave is open and thus not running,
  so we are not heating the $(OBJ) up yet.

  4. The $(OBJ) is still in the microwave. The microwave is still open.

  5. We are holding the $(OBJ) again. Although it was in the microwave, we didn''t close the
  microwave and turn it on, which means we did not heat it.

label_prompts:
  microwave: We heat the $(OBJ) in the microwave
  approach: We go to the microwave and then immediately leave without putting the $(OBJ)
    in
  open_no_put: We open the microwave and immediately close it again, without putting the
    $(OBJ) in
  put_no_close: We open the microwave, put the $(OBJ) in, then immediately pick it back
    up without heating it
  put_no_turn_on: We put the $(OBJ) in the microwave for a while, we do not turn the microwave
    on, then we pick up the $(OBJ) back again

prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us carrying $(A_OR_AN_OBJ) to a microwave and then possibly
  heating it there. Your eventual goal will be to discern whether all the steps required
  for heating the object actually happened, but you shouldn't lock-in to one answer
  too early. Instead, for each frame, concisely describe the scene, the objects we're
  holding, and what actions have likely been performed since the last frame.
