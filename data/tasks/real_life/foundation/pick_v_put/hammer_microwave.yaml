  Example:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are near an oven.

  2. Now it seems we walked near an open microwave. We don''t appear to have anything in
  hand. There is a hammer in the microwave, along with a spoon and a glass.

  3. We seem to be holding the hammer now, because it is at the bottom of the
  screen, almost as if it was lying on the floor.

  4. We are definitely holding the hammer since our hand is visible now. We are further
  from the microwave now, possibly walking towards somewhere else.

  5. We still hold the hammer.

prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us handling a hammer, and your eventual goal will
  be to discern whether picked it up during the video, or started out holding it and
  put it down somewhere. You shouldn't lock-in to one answer too early. Instead, for
  each frame, concisely describe the scene, the state of the hammer, and what
  actions have likely been performed since the last frame.
