prompt_gpt: "Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict a faucet, and your eventual goal will be to discern
  whether we turned it on or off during the video. You shouldn't lock-in to one
  answer too early. Instead, for each frame, concisely describe the scene and the state
  of the faucet and what actions have likely been performed since the last frame."
