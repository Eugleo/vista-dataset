prompt_gpt: "The frames will depict us standing in front of or walking towards a desk lamp. Your
  eventual goal will be to say whether the desk lamp has been on or off in the video.
  The on/off state of the object won't change during the video. You shouldn't lock-in
  to one answer too early. Instead, for each frame, concisely describe the
  scene, the state of the desk lamp, and what actions have likely been performed
  since the last frame."
