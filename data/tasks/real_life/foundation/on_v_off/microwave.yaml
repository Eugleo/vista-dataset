Example:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are near the countertop. We see a microwave in front of us.

  2. The microwave doesn''t seem to be turned on. Its light is not on, and the number
  is the same as in the previous frame, suggesting that it is not counting down.

  3. Nothing has changed; the microwave is still off.

  4. Again, similar frame, the microwave is still off, as we would expect.

  5. For the entire length of the video, the microwave has been off.

prompt_gpt: "The frames will depict us standing in front of or walking towards a microwave. Your
  eventual goal will be to say whether the microwave has been on or off in the video.
  The on/off state of the object won't change during the video. You shouldn't lock-in
  to one answer too early. Instead, for each frame, concisely describe the
  scene, the state of the microwave, and what actions have likely been performed
  since the last frame."
