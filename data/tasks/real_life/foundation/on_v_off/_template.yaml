  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are near the countertop. We see $(A_OR_AN_OBJ) in front of us.

  2. The $(OBJ) doesn''t seem to be turned on. $(TASK_SPECIFIC)

  3. Nothing has changed; the $(OBJ) is still off.

  4. Again, similar frame, the $(OBJ) is still off, as we would expect.

  5. For the entire length of the video, the $(OBJ) has been off.

prompt_gpt: "The frames will depict us standing in front of or walking towards $(A_OR_AN_OBJ). Your
  eventual goal will be to say whether the $(OBJ) has been on or off in the video.
  The on/off state of the object won't change during the video. You shouldn't lock-in
  to one answer too early. Instead, for each frame, concisely describe the
  scene, the state of the $(OBJ), and what actions have likely been performed
  since the last frame."
