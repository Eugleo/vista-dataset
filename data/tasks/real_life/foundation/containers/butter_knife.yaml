Example:


  (note that this example is for five frames for illustration purposes, but you should
  work with as many frames as you are given)


  Input: [5 frames]


  Frame-by-frame description:

  1. We are by a counter, holding a butter knife.

  2. We have turned toward the sink, still holding the butter knife.

  3. We are in front of an open microwave. The butter knife is no longer in the frame;
  it may have been put down or we may still be holding it, since the hand that was
  holding it is not visible either.

  4. The butter knife is in the microwave, and our hand is on the door of the microwave.

  5. We have turned toward the stove. Part of the microwave is still visible,
  and the door seems to be closed.

prompt_gpt: Your task is to describe what you see in each frame, separately, in a
  list. The frames will depict us putting down a butter knife somewhere. Your eventual goal
  will be to recognize the place or container we put the object in (or on), but you
  shouldn't lock-in to one answer too early. Instead, try to describe the place or
  container as accurately as possible separately for each frame, refining your answer
  as you see more frames.
